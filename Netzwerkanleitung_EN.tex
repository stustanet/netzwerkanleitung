\section*{General information about your Internet connection}

This set-up guide will help you to configure your computer to access the Studentenstadt network as well as the Internet. Before attempting to connect to the Internet please read the terms of use, which can be found at the end of your housing contract.

To access the Internet you will require a computer with an ethernet connector (most computers have this feature built-in). Additionally, you will need a network cable (RJ-45 patch cable) to connect your computer to the network outlet located on the wall of your room. Should you not have a network cable, you can purchase a cable from the StuStaNet. See below for more information

You are responsible for your computer's network activity. You must ensure that it does not pose a threat to any other computer on the network and that it is secured and protected from possible virus- and malware infection. This involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Keeping your computer updated with the latest security updates
    \item Updating your anti-virus program regularly
    \item Using a personal firewall
\end{itemize}
If the StuSta detects that your computer is infected by a virus and poses a threat to the computer network, your Internet connection will be cut off.

\begin{em}
In case of repeated infractions, your Internet connection will be permanently terminated.
\end{em}

These drastic measures are necessary because the entire network can be crippled by a single infected computer. Furthermore, the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (Leibniz-Rechenzentrum, LRZ), which provides the Studentenstadt with Internet access, will block all Internet traffic from the entire Studentenstadt if they detect a computer virus.

\emph{Please note:} If you are a beginner and don't have the technical know-how necessary to keep a Windows system secure, the StuStaNet recommends that you consider installing a GNU/Linux operating system such as Ubuntu. You can download Ubuntu at \url{http://www.ubuntu.com}.


\section*{Membership in the StuStaNet~e.V.}

Membership in the StuStaNet~e.V. requires a one-time fee of \EUR{20} and has a number of advantages including (in addition to Internet via Proxy), full Internet over a NAT masquerader, your own e-mail address, webspace with PHP and database support\footnote{\url{http://stusta-wiki.de/Services}}.

You can join the StuStaNet~e.V. at one of our office hours, which are Mondays and Thursdays from 19.00 to 19.30 in the Blue House (House \#11), room 0028, during the semester (during breaks only Thursdays). Therefore, please register first at \url{reg.stusta.de}.

If you are interested in our network and our servers or if you would just like to contribute some ideas, you can become a network administrator (elections are at the beginning of each semester in each house) or just visit our monthly meeting (Adminrat). This meeting takes place on the first Thursday of every month at 20.00 in the Hackerspace\footnote{2nd floor, House 10, Hans-Leipelt-Str. 7}. Although the meetings are usually held in German, we can certainly make accommodations for non-German speakers.

\section*{More Information}

\section*{Tips on securing your computer}

Here are a few tips on securing your computer against harmful software.

\subsection*{Anti virus programs}
\paragraph*{Windows}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|p{.2\linewidth}XX|}
    \hline
    Name & Website & Description\\
    \hline \hline
    Avira AntiVir & \url{http://www.free-av.com/} & free, since 1988\\
    \hline
    Microsoft Security Essentials & \url{http://www.microsoft.com/security\_essentials/} & free, by Microsoft, also anti spyware\\
    \hline
    Sophos Antivirus & \url{http://sophos.lrz-muenchen.de/} & Commercial software which is supplied by the LRZ, that can be used for free by students\\
    \hline
    avast! & \url{http://www.avast.com/} & Home Edition free for private use\\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

There are numerous other anti-virus programs such as Kaspersky, Norton and McAffee. However, these programs are commercial and require a paid license.

\paragraph*{MacOS (Apple)}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|p{.2\linewidth}XX|}
    \hline
    Name & Website & Description\\
    \hline \hline
    Avira Free Mac Security & \url{https://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-mac-security} & free\\
    \hline
    Sophos Antivirus & \url{http://sophos.lrz-muenchen.de/} & Commercial software which is supplied by the LRZ, that can be used for free by students\\
    \hline
    avast! Free AV for MAC & \url{http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-mac} & Free Edition free for private use\\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

There are numerous other anti-virus programs such as Kaspersky, Norton and Bitdefender. However, these programs are commercial and require a paid license.

\paragraph*{Linux}

There is no need to use an anti virus package with this operating system. Due to its small market share and different software architecture, this platform is mostly virus-free (for now). There are still programs available to prevent your computer from spreading Windows viruses; the programs listed above may have such versions for Linux.

\subsection*{Anti-spyware Programs}

Spyware is used to spy on users and to collect personal information. You can find more information on Wikipedia\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware}}.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|p{.18\linewidth}Xp{.3\linewidth}|}
    \hline
    Name & Website & Description\\
    \hline \hline
    Windows Defender & \url{http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17} & Integrated in Microsoft Security Essentials\\
    \hline
    Spybot, Search \& Destroy & \url{http://www.safer-networking.org/} & Free for private use\\
    \hline
    Ad-Aware & \url{http://www.lavasoft.com/products/select\_your\_product.php} & Free version available\\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

There are numerous other anti-spyware programs, most of which are commercial software. These usually come in combination with a firewall or anti virus program.

\subsection*{Personal Firewalls}

A firewall controls the connection between a computer and the network to which the computer is connected. You can find more information on Wikipedia\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal\_Firewall}}.

Almost every anti-virus program, and even some anti-spyware software, has an integrated firewall .

In general, the integrated firewall of an operating system is not sufficient to ensure complete protection.
\newpage

\section*{Network configuration}

Each network outlet is assigned eight IP addresses and the IP range is marked on the outlets. Also you should have received a note containing your networksettings with your rental agreement. If the sticker is unreadable or missing and you did not get the note containing the networksettings, please refer to the administration.

\subsection*{Overview}

To successfully connect to the Internet you need to follow these steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Connect to the network outlet (Ethernet jack)
    \item Configure the network settings in your operating system
    \item Enter proxy information~/ proxy script into your Web browser
\end{itemize}


\begin{center}
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|lXp{.2\linewidth}|}
    \hline
    Setting & Value & Example \\
    \hline \hline
    IP address & \nolinkurl{10.150.xxx.yyy} - \nolinkurl{10.150.xxx.zzz}, \newline 8 addresses are available which are marked on the network point & \nolinkurl{10.150.243.16} - \nolinkurl{10.150.243.23} \\
    \hline
    Subnet mask & \nolinkurl{255.255.255.0} & \\
    \hline
    Standard gateway & \nolinkurl{10.150.xxx.254} \newline first three blocks like the IP address, fourth block \nolinkurl{254} & \nolinkurl{10.150.243.254} \\
    \hline
    DNS server (Nameserver) & \nolinkurl{10.150.127.2} \newline \nolinkurl{10.150.125.2} & \\
    \hline
    DNS suffix (Domainname) & \nolinkurl{stusta.mhn.de} & \\
    \hline
    Proxy script & \multicolumn{2}{l|}{\nolinkurl{http://wpad.stusta.mhn.de/proxy.pac}} \\
    \hline
    Proxy server (manual) & \multicolumn{2}{l|}{\nolinkurl{http://proxy.stusta.mhn.de:3128}} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

You must use either the proxy script (preferred) or the manual proxy configuration.

\subsection*{Connection to the network outlet}

You should only use the left Ethernet socket.

\emph{Attention}: It is \emph{prohibited} to connect a telephone, ISDN equipment or any similar devices to the left network connection point as these cause massive network disruptions in the Sudentenstadt and can cause damage to our network hardware.

\subsection*{E-mail, Skype, ICQ, Online games, ...}

The Internet connection in the Sudentenstadt is intended for academic and scientific purposes only.

The standard Internet access in the Studentenstadt is limited to browsing only (Connections via the HTTP proxy) as well as internal connections to the Munich Scientific Network (Münchner Wissenschaftsnetz, MWN). Sending e-mail over POP3~/ IMAP, using instant messaging and playing online games is only possible with a StuStaNet~e.V. membership (see above).

\subsection*{Wifi in StuSta}
There is no central wifi in StuSta, due to massive concrete walls.

But you can setup your own wifi. If you do so, please consinder this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proper country selection (DE)
    \item Only use Channels 1, 6 or 11 or use 5 GHz
    \item Use secure encryption and passwords (WPA2 only)
\end{itemize}

If you use an AccessPoint (AP), every device connected needs one of the eight room IPs assigned manually. If you use a wifi-router, it need one of the room IPs assigned (and all the other configuration as described before, like netmask and gateway). The router will then configure connected devices automaticaly, providing it is configured properly. (Non-members have to configure the Proxy in all cases on every single device connected.)

\vspace{2em}

StuStaNet e. V. sells pre-configured and easy to setup wifi-routers during office ours (members only).
